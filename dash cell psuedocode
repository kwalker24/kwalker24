The Dash Cell Phone Company charges customers a basic rate of $5 per month to send text messages. Additional rates are as follows:
The first 100 messages per month, regardless of message length, are included in the basic bill.
An additional three cents are charged for each text message after the 100th message, up to and including 300 messages.
An additional two cents are charged for each text message after the 300th message.
Federal, state, and local taxes add a total of 14 percent to each bill.

Design a flowchart or pseudocode for the following:
A program that accepts the following data about one customerâ€™s messages: area code (three digits), phone number (seven digits), and number of text messages sent. Display all the data, including the month-end bill both before and after taxes are added.
A program that continually accepts data about text messages until a sentinel value is entered and displays all the details.
A program that continually accepts data about text messages until a sentinel value is entered and displays details only about customers who send more than 100 text messages.
A program that continually accepts data about text messages until a sentinel value is entered and displays details only about customers whose total bill with taxes is over $10.
A program that prompts the user for a three-digit area code from which to select bills. Then the program continually accepts text message data until a sentinel value is entered and displays data only for messages sent from the specified area code.

start
  baseRate = $5
  messageRateMid = $0.03
  messageLimitMid = 100
  messageRateHigh = $0.02
  messageLimitHigh = 300
  taxRate = 0.14

  if messagesSent <= 100 then
    bill = baseRate
  else if messagesSent <= 300 then
    bill = baseRate + (messagesSent - 100) * messageRateMid
  else
    bill = baseRate + (200 * messageRateMid) + (messagesSent - 300) * messageRateHigh
  endif

  billWithTax = bill + (bill * taxRate)
  output billWithTax
end
